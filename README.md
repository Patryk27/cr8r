# cr8r

Run experiments across parts of _a_ Rust ecosystem!

## Brief

cr8r (pronounced _crater_) is a tool that strives to be an intranet-oriented clone of [Crater](https://github.com/rust-lang/crater).

Essentially: instead of performing experiments on the entire Rust's ecosystem, you configure a list of your own
projects and practice on them, on your own computer(s).

Currently you can check how your code will behave:
- ... with different version of Rust's toolchain,
- ... with different version of any crate inside your dependency chain.
